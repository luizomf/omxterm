# Native development reference

Start with [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md#development-environment) to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run OMXTerm in development mode. This guide covers OS-specific prerequisites, running unit and graphical integration tests, and verifying native packages.

See the [Restty guide](restty-development.md) for Terminal Surface internals and [release procedures](release.md) for full release builds.

## Platform prerequisites

Development targets native ARM64 macOS, Linux, and Windows (ARM64 or x64) with **Node.js 22.13+ (22.x) or 24+** and npm. When working inside a virtual machine, clone and build on the guest's native filesystem rather than a shared host folder.

### macOS

Install **Xcode Command Line Tools** (`xcode-select --install`) before running `npm ci`.

- `postinstall` compiles the pinned Unix `node-pty` native addon.
- `npm run build` compiles `native/macos-window-blur.mm` using bundled Node-API headers (targeting macOS 12.0+).

### Linux

Install C++ build tools, Python 3, `patch`, `binutils`, `procps`, `fontconfig`, `file`, XWayland, and the required test fixture fonts (`DejaVu Sans`, `DejaVu Sans Mono`, and `Liberation Mono`):

```sh
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install build-essential python3 patch binutils procps fontconfig file xwayland fonts-dejavu-core fonts-liberation

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ make python3 patch binutils procps-ng fontconfig file xorg-x11-server-Xwayland dejavu-sans-fonts dejavu-sans-mono-fonts liberation-mono-fonts

# Arch / Omarchy
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel python patch binutils procps-ng fontconfig file xorg-xwayland ttf-dejavu ttf-liberation
```

Verify that the fixture fonts are installed with `fc-list : family` (missing fixture fonts cause native font integration tests to fail with `Configured native fixture font is missing`).

If `npm ci` failed part-way because a system tool like `patch` or `make` was missing, install the missing package and run:

```sh
npm run postinstall && npm run check:portable
```

OMXTerm runs with `--no-sandbox` on Linux ([ADR 0024](adr/0024-disable-the-chromium-sandbox-on-linux.md)) and uses X11/XWayland. `npm run dev` passes `--no-sandbox` automatically; if launching Electron directly for debugging, run `npx electron --no-sandbox .`.

### Windows

1. Enable **Developer Mode** in Windows Settings before cloning or running tests so non-elevated processes can create symbolic links.
2. Clone with `git clone -c core.autocrlf=false -c core.symlinks=true ...` to preserve LF line endings and repository symlinks.
3. Install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable that matches your machine (**ARM64** or **x64**), and C++ build tools if building native addons from source. Without it, `npm ci` fails while loading native modules.
4. Run development and test commands as a normal (non-Administrator) user inside an interactive desktop session (not a headless SSH Session 0).

To verify that your user account can create symlinks before running `npm ci`, run in a non-elevated PowerShell window:

```powershell
@'
const fs = require('node:fs');
const os = require('node:os');
const path = require('node:path');
const root = fs.mkdtempSync(path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'omxterm-symlink-check-'));
try {
  fs.writeFileSync(path.join(root, 'target.txt'), 'ok');
  const link = path.join(root, 'link.txt');
  fs.symlinkSync('target.txt', link, 'file');
  if (fs.readFileSync(link, 'utf8') !== 'ok') throw new Error('Symlink read failed');
  console.log('PASS: ordinary-user file symlink creation');
} finally {
  fs.rmSync(root, { recursive: true, force: true });
}
'@ | node
```

If PowerShell blocks local npm scripts, start a process-scoped session from your desktop terminal:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
npm.cmd ci
npm.cmd run check:portable
```

## Test discovery

Vitest discovers `*.test.*` and `*.spec.*` files under `test/unit/` and `test/integration/`. Support code lives in `test/fixtures/`.

- `npm test -- test/unit` — runs fast, headless unit tests only.
- `npm test` — runs the full default suite (unit + integration).
- `npm run test:integration` — runs `test/integration/local-shell.test.ts` only.
- `npx vitest list --filesOnly --json` — lists discovered test files without running them.

Test runs write a summary to `.scratch/vitest-results.json`.

## Running native tests

> **Warning:** Graphical integration tests open and focus real Electron windows. Run them on an unlocked, logged-in desktop with WebGL2 support. Leave the mouse and keyboard idle during the run, do not resize or switch windows, and run only one graphical test suite at a time per desktop.

<a id="qualification-scope"></a>

### Qualification scope

`npm run check:portable` is the baseline for every code change (formatting, lint, typecheck, the default Vitest suite, and an unpackaged build). Two things to know before running it:

- On Linux, run the full suite from an external system terminal, not inside OMXTerm itself. The About integration fixtures can hit a relaunch timeout when nested inside OMXTerm on Fedora and Ubuntu ([#609](https://github.com/luizomf/omxterm/issues/609)).
- Known runtime limitations that tests account for are listed in the [Restty guide](restty-development.md#current-runtime-limitations).

### Focused checks

While iterating on a specific subsystem, you can run targeted test files before running the full suite:

The `auxiliary-panel` suite uses the production window host, real Surfaces/PTYs,
native menu callbacks and Chromium synthetic input through the main keybind
matcher (default and remapped). It covers bounded geometry, captured pointer and
keyboard resize, retained hidden-tab output/grid, window independence, small
height, light/dark reload, chrome/fullscreen and About/image transitions. It does
not establish physical keyboard layouts, OS pointer hardware or cross-platform
pixel parity. Like the suites below, run it only on an idle unlocked desktop.

The `window-chrome` suite includes an independent `about-only` scenario so an
unrelated native geometry failure cannot skip About coverage. Run it alone with
`npm test -- test/integration/window-chrome.test.ts -t about-only`. It exercises
the real menu callback, preload, dialog and Terminal Surface, using synthetic
keyboard input. For an explicitly scheduled browser handoff check, set
`OMXTERM_TEST_ABOUT_BROWSER=1`: it opens the fixed project page in the default
browser, observes focus leaving OMXTerm, then returns focus to the dialog.
`OMXTERM_ABOUT_EVIDENCE_DIR` optionally saves fixture-only normal/small light/dark
PNG captures. These checks still require an idle unlocked desktop; they do not
claim physical keyboard navigation or pixel parity across platforms.

### Opt-in native test suites

Several specialized integration suites are skipped by default and enabled via environment variables:

| Suite                        | Command                                                                                                                                | Notes                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS fullscreen blur        | `OMXTERM_TEST_MACOS_FULLSCREEN=1 npx vitest run test/integration/macos-window-blur.test.ts`                                            | Exercises native macOS fullscreen transitions for direct blur and HUD fallback.               |
| AltGr layout boundary        | `OMXTERM_TEST_ALTGR_NATIVE=1 npx vitest run test/integration/altgr-native.test.ts`                                                     | Requires an active US International AltGr layout (and `/dev/uinput` on Linux).                |
| Font stroke evidence         | `OMXTERM_FONT_STYLES_EVIDENCE_PATH="$PWD/.scratch/font-obs.json" npx vitest run test/integration/restty-font-styles-rendering.test.ts` | Saves comparison JSON and synthetic glyph PNG captures alongside the test run.                |
| Local-image preview capacity | `OMXTERM_TEST_IMAGE_CAPACITY=1 npx vitest run test/integration/local-image-capacity-native.test.ts`                                    | Measures repeated 64 MiB preview open/close cycles into `.scratch/local-image-capacity.json`. |
| `tmux` host comparison       | `OMXTERM_TEST_IMAGE_TMUX=1 npx vitest run test/integration/restty-host-integration.test.ts`                                            | Requires `tmux` installed on a POSIX desktop.                                                 |

<a id="interruption-regressions"></a>

#### Interruption regressions

These opt-in suites deliberately terminate fixture-owned processes to test cleanup and recovery. Run them only inside a disposable VM:

```sh
OMXTERM_TEST_NATIVE_INTERRUPTION=1 npm test -- test/integration/native-fixture-interruption.test.ts test/integration/native-fixture-early-exit.test.ts
```

On Windows, additional WMI outcome and bootstrap suites are available:

```powershell
$env:OMXTERM_TEST_NATIVE_INTERRUPTION = '1'
npm test -- test/integration/native-fixture-interruption.test.ts test/integration/native-fixture-early-exit.test.ts test/integration/native-fixture-outcome-windows.test.ts test/integration/native-fixture-bootstrap-windows.test.ts
Remove-Item Env:OMXTERM_TEST_NATIVE_INTERRUPTION
```

<a id="evidence-reuse-and-packaging"></a>

### Packaging and verification commands

Complete native checks run `check:portable`, build the platform installer into `release/`, and verify the packaged artifact locally (without publishing):

| Platform      | Complete native check                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS ARM64   | `npm run check`                                                  |
| Linux ARM64   | `npm run check:linux`                                            |
| Windows ARM64 | `npm run check:win -- --disposable-vm-allow-omxterm-replacement` |
| Windows x64   | `npm run check:win -- --disposable-vm-allow-omxterm-replacement` |

> **Warning:** Full Windows verification (`check:win` or `package:verify` with `--disposable-vm-allow-omxterm-replacement`) runs the NSIS installer and can replace an existing OMXTerm installation on the machine. Run it only in a disposable VM with a recovery snapshot ([Windows release procedure](release.md#windows-arm64-and-x64)). To verify only the unpacked Windows app directory without running the installer, use:
>
> ```powershell
> npm run package:win        # ARM64; use npm run package:win:x64 on x64
> npm run package:verify -- --windows-unpacked-only
> ```

See [release procedures](release.md#resume-and-version-only-commands) for standalone `package:*` and `package-built:*` commands.

## Fixture ownership and cleanup

Graphical integration tests use [`runNativeFixture`](../test/fixtures/run-native-fixture.ts) and [`prepareFixture`](../test/fixtures/prepare-fixture.ts) to manage temporary user profiles, child Electron processes, and PTYs (`spawnFixturePty` / `spawnFixtureProcess`):

- Fixture diagnostics and stdout/stderr logs are written under `.scratch/native-fixtures/`.
- The supervisor removes temporary profiles only after verifying that child processes have exited and streams have closed.
- If a fixture process cannot be cleanly verified on exit, it writes an `ownership-blocked.json` receipt in `.scratch/native-fixtures/` and blocks further launches in that scope until inspected (except for abandoned Windows pre-bootstrap receipts whose parent process has already exited, which are archived automatically).

To run the unit tests for fixture preparation and supervision headlessly:

```sh
npx vitest run test/unit/fixture-preparation.test.ts test/unit/fixture-preparation-recipes.test.ts test/unit/fixture-preparation-callers.test.ts test/unit/native-preparation-ownership.test.ts test/unit/run-native-fixture-windows.test.ts test/unit/native-fixture-recovery.test.ts
```
